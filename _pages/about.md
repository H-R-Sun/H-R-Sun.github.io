I am Haoran Sun, a recent graduate with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Statistics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. With a strong foundation in data science and machine learning, I have participated in various research projects, including medical image classification and predicting stress cardiomyopathy using neural networks.

In my free time, I enjoy enhancing my technical skills in Python, R, C++, and Java, and I am always eager to explore new challenges in data science and statistical modeling.
