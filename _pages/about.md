I am Haoran Sun, and I hold an M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Statistics from Johns Hopkins University, completed in May 2024. I previously earned a B.S. in Statistics with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Minnesota.

My research has focused on applying machine learning techniques to healthcare data, including ECG-based prediction models, and evaluating large vision models using cognitive development benchmarks.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning, statistical analysis, and healthcare innovation. I have expertise in Python, R, C++, and Java, and I am fluent in both English and Mandarin.
